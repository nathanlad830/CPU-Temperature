# CPU-Temperature
Monitors the CPU temperature and records it in a file

IMPORTANT

You need to make the .sh file executable using 
<br><code> chmod +x temperature_log.sh</code>
<br>After you can execute it using 
<br><code>./temperature_log.sh</code>

Another Notice!
You must make a <code>logs</code> folder using
<code>mkdir logs</code>
<br> in the /home/pi directory
<br> Feel free to change the save format to something like .xml so you can use it in excel and do some fancy calculations and graphs if you feel the urge
